  - No longer exists in the components directory

- **Signup Page** - `app/signup.jsx`
  - Removed animation-related state and functions
  - Simplified "Sign In" button to directly navigate to login page
  - Removed conditional rendering and PageFlipAnimation wrapper
  - Now uses standard navigation without flip effects
